# Recommended strategy for the DDI module

> **Convert the ~100 drug monographs once into a structured, versioned DDI knowledge base, validate it, and make the runtime checker a deterministic database lookup.**

Your sample is suitable for this. It contains a recognizable `Interactions` section with severity groups such as `Contraindicated`, `Serious`, `Monitor Closely`, and `Minor`. :chatgpt-content-reference{index="0"} Individual entries then contain the interacting substance plus free-text mechanism and management information; for example, the erdafitinib entry describes the effect on sitagliptin and then provides an avoidance/administration recommendation. :chatgpt-content-reference{index="1"}

---

# 1. Requirements

## Functional requirements

The module should accept something like:

```json
{
  "medications": [
    "sitagliptin",
    "aripiprazole",
    "benazepril"
  ]
}
```

and return every interaction found between those medications:

```json
{
  "interactions": [
    {
      "drug_a": "sitagliptin",
      "drug_b": "aripiprazole",
      "severity": "monitor_closely",
      "effect": "...",
      "mechanism": "...",
      "management": "...",
      "source": "Sitagliptin.txt"
    }
  ]
}
```

The important distinction is:

```text
No DDI record found
```

must **never** automatically mean:

```text
These drugs do not interact
```

Your database only knows what exists in the source material you imported.

---

# 2. High-level architecture

I would separate this into **two very different systems**.

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

That separation is important.

The **ingestion pipeline can be complicated**.

The **runtime checker should be extremely simple**.

---

# 3. Do not make an LLM the DDI engine

This is the most important architectural decision.

Avoid:

```text
Doctor enters drugs
       ↓
Send monographs to GPT
       ↓
"Do these interact?"
       ↓
Display answer
```

You would introduce hallucination risk, nondeterministic answers, latency, difficult auditing, and difficult regression testing.

Instead:

```text
Drug A + Drug B
      ↓
normalized IDs
      ↓
database query
      ↓
stored source-derived interaction
```

For a medical CDSS, the final interaction determination should be traceable back to a stored record.

An LLM can optionally help **during ingestion**, for example identifying an unusually formatted paragraph, but anything produced by it should still be validated before entering the production KB.

---

# 4. Your source requires more than a simple `drugA → drugB → severity` table

This is an important finding from the Sitagliptin sample.

Consider ofloxacin.

One entry places it within the `Monitor Closely` portion and describes hyper/hypoglycemia. :chatgpt-content-reference{index="2"}

Later, ofloxacin appears again under the `Minor` portion as:

> unspecified interaction mechanism / potential dysglycemia

:chatgpt-content-reference{index="3"}

Therefore this schema would be wrong:

```text
sitagliptin + ofloxacin
    severity = ?
```

There can be **multiple source assertions about the same pair**.

Use an evidence-based model instead.

---

# 5. Recommended data model

## `drug`

```text
drug
----
id
canonical_name
normalized_name
concept_type
active
```

Example:

```text
23
sitagliptin
sitagliptin
ingredient
true
```

`concept_type` should support more than prescription drugs because your source includes things such as ethanol, marijuana, cinnamon, bitter melon, American ginseng, etc.

Possible values:

```text
ingredient
combination_drug
herbal
food
substance
other
```

---

## `drug_alias`

```text
drug_alias
----------
id
drug_id
alias
normalized_alias
alias_type
```

For the sample:

```text
sitagliptin
Januvia
Zituvio
Brynovin
```

The monograph explicitly gives these brand names. :chatgpt-content-reference{index="4"}

This lets:

```text
Januvia
Sitagliptin
JANUVIA
sitagliptin 100 mg
```

eventually resolve to the same medication concept.

Do **not** rely on raw strings when checking interactions.

---

## `source_document`

```text
source_document
---------------
id
primary_drug_id
filename
source_name
source_url
document_date
checksum
imported_at
parser_version
```

The checksum matters.

If you later replace:

```text
Sitagliptin.txt
```

with a newer version, the system can detect that the underlying source changed and rebuild affected records.

---

## `interaction_evidence`

This should be the core table.

```text
interaction_evidence
--------------------
id

drug_a_id
drug_b_id

subject_drug_id
object_drug_id

source_document_id

source_severity
action_class

mechanism
effect
management
raw_text

source_location

parser_confidence
review_status
created_at
```

Why both:

```text
drug_a_id
drug_b_id
```

and:

```text
subject_drug_id
object_drug_id
```

?

Because lookup should be symmetrical:

```text
sitagliptin + sotorasib
```

and:

```text
sotorasib + sitagliptin
```

must find the same DDI.

But the underlying statement is directional:

> sotorasib will decrease the level or effect of sitagliptin

:chatgpt-content-reference{index="5"}

So you must preserve directionality rather than converting everything into a generic `"interacts with"` relationship.

---

# 6. Keep `severity` separate from `recommended action`

Do not collapse all clinical information into one enum.

The document contains information such as:

```text
Severity category:
Serious

Effect:
increases level/effect

Mechanism:
P-glycoprotein transporter

Management:
Avoid or use alternate drug
```

Those are different concepts.

For example:

```json
{
  "source_severity": "serious",
  "effect": "increase_level_or_effect",
  "mechanism": "P-glycoprotein (MDR1) efflux transporter",
  "action": "avoid_or_use_alternate",
  "management_text": "..."
}
```

This will become valuable later if INSIGHT needs rules such as:

```text
show only Contraindicated/Serious interactions
```

or:

```text
show DDIs requiring glucose monitoring
```

or:

```text
find interactions caused by CYP3A4
```

---

# 7. Parsing strategy

I would **not start by giving all 100 files to an LLM**.

The sample is sufficiently structured to justify a deterministic parser.

The interaction area follows recognizable category headings such as:

```text
Contraindicated (0)
Serious (4)
Monitor Closely (92)
Minor (70)
```

:chatgpt-content-reference{index="6"} :chatgpt-content-reference{index="7"}

Use a parser implemented as a state machine.

```text
OUTSIDE_INTERACTIONS
        │
        │ find "Interactions"
        ▼
INSIDE_INTERACTIONS
        │
        ├── Contraindicated (N)
        │
        ├── Serious (N)
        │
        ├── Monitor Closely (N)
        │
        └── Minor (N)
                  │
                  ▼
             ENTRY_NAME
                  │
                  ▼
            ENTRY_CONTENT
                  │
                  ▼
             NEXT ENTRY
```

### Preprocessing

Before parsing:

```text
remove page headers
remove timestamps
remove repeated website URLs
join wrapped lines
normalize whitespace
retain original line offsets
```

But keep the original document untouched for provenance.

---

# 8. Use the source counts as automatic integrity checks

This is one of the strongest characteristics of these documents.

If a document says:

```text
Serious (4)
```

your parser should obtain exactly:

```text
4 serious entries
```

If it obtains 3 or 5:

```text
INGESTION FAILED
```

Do not silently continue.

Similarly:

```text
Monitor Closely (92)
```

should produce the corresponding number of parsed entries in that category.

That gives you a built-in validation system.

For each monograph generate:

```text
Sitagliptin.txt

Contraindicated:
expected: 0
parsed:   0
PASS

Serious:
expected: 4
parsed:   4
PASS

Monitor Closely:
expected: 92
parsed:   92
PASS

Minor:
expected: 70
parsed:   70
PASS
```

This is much safer than trying to judge parsing quality subjectively.

---

# 9. Drug normalization is probably the hardest part

Suppose one file says:

```text
quetiapine
```

another says:

```text
quetiapine fumarate
```

and the application receives:

```text
Seroquel
```

A string lookup would fail.

You therefore need a normalization layer:

```text
Input name
    ↓
lowercase / whitespace normalization
    ↓
exact canonical match?
    ↓
alias match?
    ↓
external terminology mapping if available
    ↓
manual resolution queue
```

For the first version, maintain a controlled alias table.

Later, you could cross-reference a terminology system such as RxNorm while retaining your own internal `drug_id`.

Your application should **never silently fuzzy-match a medication name**.

For example:

```text
clozapine
clonazepam
clomipramine
```

must not be resolved through uncontrolled approximate matching.

If normalization fails:

```text
MEDICATION_NOT_RECOGNIZED
```

is preferable to guessing.

---

# 10. Canonical pair keys

Internally create an order-independent pair.

For example:

```text
drug ID 14 = sitagliptin
drug ID 87 = aripiprazole
```

Generate:

```text
pair_key = 14:87
```

irrespective of whether the caller sends:

```text
[sitagliptin, aripiprazole]
```

or:

```text
[aripiprazole, sitagliptin]
```

A simple implementation is:

```python
pair_key = f"{min(a, b)}:{max(a, b)}"
```

This prevents duplicate pair identities while keeping the underlying evidence directional.

---

# 11. Do not force one record per pair

Instead:

```text
PAIR
sitagliptin ↔ ofloxacin

Evidence #1
severity = monitor_closely
...

Evidence #2
severity = minor
...
```

Then derive a summary.

```text
pair_summary
------------
pair_key
highest_severity
evidence_count
has_severity_conflict
has_multiple_mechanisms
last_reviewed_at
```

For UI purposes you could display:

```text
OFLOXACIN + SITAGLIPTIN

Severity: Monitor Closely

2 interaction statements found

• Potential dysglycemia ...
• Pharmacodynamic synergism ...

Source: ...
```

The important point is that **the source material remains intact**.

---

# 12. Runtime checking algorithm

If a patient has:

```text
A
B
C
D
```

generate:

```text
A-B
A-C
A-D
B-C
B-D
C-D
```

The number of comparisons is:

```text
n(n-1)/2
```

Even with 30 medications:

```text
30 × 29 / 2 = 435
```

which is trivial for a relational database.

No special scaling architecture is required.

Pseudo-code:

```python
def check_interactions(medications):
    drugs = normalize_drugs(medications)

    unresolved = [d for d in drugs if not d.resolved]

    pairs = generate_unique_pairs(
        [d.id for d in drugs if d.resolved]
    )

    evidence = interaction_repository.find_for_pairs(pairs)

    return aggregate_results(
        evidence=evidence,
        unresolved=unresolved
    )
```

---

# 13. Recommended API

A single endpoint is enough initially.

```http
POST /api/ddi/check
```

Request:

```json
{
  "medications": [
    {"name": "Januvia"},
    {"name": "aripiprazole"},
    {"name": "benazepril"}
  ]
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "resolved_medications": [
    {
      "input": "Januvia",
      "canonical_name": "sitagliptin",
      "drug_id": "drug_001"
    }
  ],

  "unresolved_medications": [],

  "interactions": [
    {
      "drug_a": {
        "id": "drug_001",
        "name": "sitagliptin"
      },
      "drug_b": {
        "id": "drug_047",
        "name": "aripiprazole"
      },

      "severity": "monitor_closely",

      "evidence": [
        {
          "effect": "...",
          "mechanism": "...",
          "management": "...",
          "source_document": "Sitagliptin.txt"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The sample specifically states that atypical antipsychotics such as aripiprazole can be associated with hyperglycemia and recommends close glucose monitoring. :chatgpt-content-reference{index="8"}

That is the kind of source content the API should expose, rather than generating new clinical prose.

---

# 14. Storage choice

For your current scale, I would use:

> **PostgreSQL if INSIGHT already uses PostgreSQL. Otherwise SQLite is completely adequate for the standalone prototype.**

You do **not** need:

- a vector database;
- Elasticsearch;
- Neo4j;
- a dedicated graph database;
- a large language model;
- Redis;
- Kafka.

A DDI network looks like a graph conceptually, but relational SQL handles this workload perfectly well.

If your app already has PostgreSQL, avoid introducing another database.

---

# 15. What should happen when both monographs exist?

Eventually you may have:

```text
Sitagliptin.txt

contains:
sitagliptin ↔ aripiprazole
```

and:

```text
Aripiprazole.txt

contains:
aripiprazole ↔ sitagliptin
```

Do **not** discard either record.

Store both as evidence:

```text
PAIR sitagliptin ↔ aripiprazole
    ├── evidence from Sitagliptin.txt
    └── evidence from Aripiprazole.txt
```

If both agree, confidence increases.

If they differ:

```text
has_conflict = true
```

and route the pair to review.

Do not have code arbitrarily overwrite the first record with the second.

---

# 16. Validation system

Because this is medical data, I would build validation into the ingestion process from day one.

The checks that matter most are:

1. **Category-count validation**
   - `Serious (4)` → exactly four parsed entries.

2. **Unknown entity validation**
   - every interacting entity must resolve to a canonical concept.

3. **Duplicate detection**
   - same pair + same statement should not be imported repeatedly.

4. **Conflict detection**
   - same pair appears with different severity or management.

5. **Source traceability**
   - every production DDI must point back to document + original text.

6. **Symmetry test**
   - `check(A,B)` and `check(B,A)` return the same pair.

7. **Parser regression tests**
   - keep representative monographs as fixtures.

8. **Manual review**
   - all `Contraindicated`;
   - all `Serious`;
   - all parser anomalies;
   - all severity conflicts;
   - all unresolved drug names.

For your ~100-document dataset, this is entirely practical.

---

# 17. Preserve the original interaction description

Do not over-normalize the clinical information.

For example, sitagliptin is described in the source as a P-gp and OAT3 substrate and a weak CYP3A4/CYP2C8 substrate. :chatgpt-content-reference{index="9"} The source also separately describes increased hypoglycemia risk with insulin or insulin secretagogues. :chatgpt-content-reference{index="10"}

You can extract normalized concepts such as:

```text
mechanism_type = P_GP
```

but also retain:

```text
raw_text
```

because your normalized schema will inevitably fail to represent some nuance.

Think:

```text
structured fields = queryable representation
raw source = clinical provenance
```

not:

```text
structured fields = replacement for source
```

---

# 18. Suggested severity model

Internally:

```text
CONTRAINDICATED
SERIOUS
MONITOR_CLOSELY
MINOR
UNKNOWN
```

For sorting only, you can assign:

```text
CONTRAINDICATED   40
SERIOUS           30
MONITOR_CLOSELY   20
MINOR             10
UNKNOWN             0
```

Those numbers should **never appear clinically**. They are only sort priorities.

Also keep separate:

```text
source_severity
```

and:

```text
management_action
```

because the prose may contain a stronger recommendation than the category heading.

---

# 19. The ingestion tool should be its own program

I would make something like:

```text
ddi/
├── ingestion/
│   ├── preprocess.py
│   ├── parser.py
│   ├── normalizer.py
│   ├── validator.py
│   └── importer.py
│
├── domain/
│   ├── drug.py
│   ├── interaction.py
│   └── severity.py
│
├── repository/
│   ├── drug_repository.py
│   └── interaction_repository.py
│
├── service/
│   └── ddi_checker.py
│
├── api/
│   └── ddi_routes.py
│
└── tests/
    ├── fixtures/
    │   └── Sitagliptin.txt
    ├── test_parser.py
    ├── test_normalizer.py
    └── test_ddi_checker.py
```

This is substantially better than embedding the parsing code inside your web application.

---

# 20. Best vibecoding workflow

Do **not** prompt an agent:

> "Build me a drug interaction system from these 100 files."

That is too large a unit of work and will produce architectural drift.

Build it incrementally:

```text
Phase 1
Define schemas and severity enums.

Phase 2
Make Sitagliptin.txt a test fixture.

Phase 3
Implement preprocessing.

Phase 4
Parse category headings and validate counts.

Phase 5
Parse individual interaction entries.

Phase 6
Implement canonical drug/alias handling.

Phase 7
Generate interaction_evidence records.

Phase 8
Run parser against all ~100 documents.

Phase 9
Produce anomaly/conflict report.

Phase 10
Manually review high-risk records.

Phase 11
Build deterministic DDI lookup service.

Phase 12
Build API.

Phase 13
Build UI.

Phase 14
Integrate it into the main application.
```

The agent should not move to the next phase until tests for the previous phase pass.

---

# 21. One particularly useful artifact: ingestion report

Every import should produce something like:

```text
DDI Knowledge Base Import
=========================

Documents discovered:       103
Documents processed:        103
Documents passed:            99

Unique drug pairs:         6,977

Duplicate evidence:           37

Parser version:
ddi-parser/1.0.0

Dataset version:

```

This gives you an auditable build process instead of an opaque collection of generated JSON.

# 22. What I would explicitly avoid

| Approach | Recommendation |
|---|---|

# 23. Final architecture

The architecture I recommend is:

```text
                    SOURCE LAYER

## The key design principle

**Your text documents should be treated as source material used to build the knowledge base—not as the knowledge base itself.**

That makes the module deterministic, testable, auditable, fast, and much easier to safely vibecode.

For your current scale of roughly 100 medication monographs, I would **not introduce microservices**. Keep the ingestion pipeline as a separate CLI/package, store the resulting data in the application's existing relational database, and expose the runtime checker as a normal application service/module. If the corpus eventually grows to tens of thousands of drugs, multiple external data sources, or continuously updated interaction feeds, the ingestion and terminology components are the first pieces I would reconsider.
